INSTALLATION
------------

DESCRIPTION

    The installation is really straightforward. The framework has been developed
    in  Python,  both  on  the client and on the server side. Refer to following
    sections for the installation process.


CLIENT

    Ensure Python (2.6.5) and  Scapy dependency are installed. On a Debian based
    Linux distribution, just issue:

        sudo apt-get install python python-scapy.

    Also  install  nmap,  hping3  and nikto. Either install them from sources or
    from the  repositories.  From the packages,  this  can  be  simply  done  by
    issuing:

        sudo apt-get install nmap hping3 nikto

    The last step  is  to configure the server.  Refer to the CONFIGURATION help
    document.

SERVER

    All you need is Python (2.6.5). On a Debian  based  Linux distribution, this
    can be done by issuing: sudo apt-get install python.

    Ensure that a FTP service is installed. You can use vsftpd:

        sudo apt-get install vsftpd

    Last thing: ports 22 and 80 must be open, you can install SSH and Apache:

        sudo apt-get install apache2 openssh-server

THIRD PARTY

    Another  server  could  be  needed  to  host malicious files (see the ./pdf/
    directory). You can also use online resources.
